# TTGOTerm

Implements a simple VT220 compatible serial terminal with some XTerm extensions with optional UTF-8 support.
It uses the [U8g2lib graphical library](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki), so it is compatible with a lot of displays.
It has been tested on the [TTGO OLED ESP8622 SH1106](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32991442463.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4d5SbjHq) hardware platform.
